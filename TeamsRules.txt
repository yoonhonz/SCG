+ Team's rules:

- There will no meetings that occur before 10am.
- The time of each meeting will be discussed weekly on the team's FB page and/or in class.
- The leader is responsible for making announcements (about tasks) at least 24 hours before the deadline of the team meeting.
- If a member is not completing his tasks on time without informing the team (and it is not because of illness/accidents, etc.), there will be a warning for the first time. If this action occurs again, then all members in the team can give a bad review to this member in the peer evaluation. If this problem occurs more than 3 times, then the team will talk to the Course Coordinator in order to remove this member from our team.
- If a member is late to meetings, there will be 1$/5mins penalty after the first 5 minutes. If that member is more than 30 mins late, it will be considered as not going a meeting.
- If a member does not come to a meeting, it will be considered as not completing his tasks on time. (unless a good reason is provided, and, a member or leader of the team is informed prior to the meeting)
- If there is conflict between members, the leader will be act as an arbitrator. If it cannot be resolved, then the problem will be reported to the course coordinator.
- If there is conflict between the leader and the member(s) and the issue cannot be resolved, then the problem will be reported to the course coordinator.
- If the team can not come to an agreement in any discussion, then a democratic process will occur (i.e. we will vote). If the vote results are equal, we will flip a coin or pick a card.
